## Overview
Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. This project aims to provide a **user-friendly, accessible web application** for skin cancer risk assessment using image classification powered by CNN models.

Users can:
- Upload images of skin lesions
- Select the body part (optional)
- Get real-time predictions with guidance
- Learn about the model and app functionality through the "Know Us" section
